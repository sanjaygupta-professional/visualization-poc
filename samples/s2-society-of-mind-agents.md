## Source Content

**Agents** are the fundamental building blocks in Minsky's theory. An agent is a simple process that does one small thing — receiving inputs and producing outputs — without understanding its role in the larger system.

### Key Characteristics

| Characteristic | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Simple** | Does only one small thing |
| **Specialized** | Has a specific function |
| **Reactive** | Responds to triggers |
| **Unaware** | Doesn't know its purpose |
| **Connected** | Linked to other agents |

### The Agent Model

An agent consists of:
- **Trigger**: Activation signal
- **Function**: What it does
- **Output**: Result/signal

Agents exist in a context with:
- Other agents they communicate with
- Memory state they can access

### Agents vs. Traditional Components

Traditional view: Parts → Whole (passive composition)

Minsky's view: Agents → Agencies → Mind (dynamic interaction)

The key difference: agents **interact dynamically** rather than being passive parts. They respond to signals, communicate, and can be activated or suppressed.

### Types of Agents

As you progress through the book, you'll encounter different types:

1. **Basic Agents** - Simple functions
2. **Memory Agents** - K-lines
3. **Control Agents** - Managers
4. **Detector Agents** - Recognize patterns

These build upon each other progressively.

### Think About It

- What makes something an "agent" rather than just a "part"?
- Can you identify agents in other systems (computers, organizations, ecosystems)?
- Why might evolution produce minds made of agents?

## Visualization Task

Create a diagram that captures what an agent is, how agents interact, and how they differ from traditional "parts" in a system.
