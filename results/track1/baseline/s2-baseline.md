# S2 Baseline: Agents (Generic Approach)

**Approach**: Standard diagram selection based on content type
- Content defines a concept → Use mindmap for overview
- Content has hierarchy → Use flowchart TB
- Applied generic color palette

## Generated Diagram

```mermaid
mindmap
  root((Agent))
    Definition
      Simple process
      No intelligence alone
      Input → Output
    Properties
      Specialized function
      No self-awareness
      Triggered by signals
    Relationships
      Forms agencies
      Communicates with others
      Part of society
    Examples
      SEE agent
      GRASP agent
      MOVE agent
```

## Supplementary Diagram

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Agent["An Agent"]
        Trigger["Trigger"]
        Function["Function"]
        Output["Output"]
        Trigger --> Function --> Output
    end

    Other["Other Agents"] <--> Agent
    Memory["Memory State"] <--> Agent

    style Agent fill:#e3f2fd,stroke:#1976d2
```

## Analysis

**What this diagram does:**
- Mindmap captures the hierarchical definition
- Flowchart shows basic input/output model
- Standard concept overview structure

**What this diagram lacks:**
- Doesn't show the key insight: agents vs traditional parts
- Missing the dynamic interaction pattern
- No visualization of how agents form agencies
- Doesn't distinguish between agent types
- Generic structure that doesn't reveal cognitive science concepts
